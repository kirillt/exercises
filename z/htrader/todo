Development & Refactoring:
    iteratee - for secure authorization to btc-e.com
    reimplement all Read instances with parser monad or something
    separate caching facility from history
    instance Num Wallet
    extend quotations with amount
    model timings (response can come in long time, should be modelled in simulation mode too (match time differences between entries in lis))
    profile - strange performance on memoizing (criterion showed other)
    provide tests
    separate btc-e logic and other concrete things into subpackage
    data Trader = Real | Simulated
    typed numbers (currencies)

Algorithms & Research:
    analyse amount
    bots often make fake bids with 0.0001 btc or something -- handle these cases too!
    multi-pair strategies, btw it is possible to test it by merging different histories into the big one
